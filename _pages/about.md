## Research Summary

The major focus of my research is understanding and optimising the long-term outcomes of medically complex pregnancies. 

My group works with placental models to understand the impact of drug treatments on the placenta. This work includes primary trophoblasts from term pregnancies and also organoid models. We currently hold substantive research grants to investigate the impact of metformin on the placenta. Our studies on metformin have had directly translatable outcomes, including citations in drug licensing for gestational diabetes, citations in international intrapartum care guidelines, and bringing a new drug therapy for gestational diabetes into a first-in-pregnancy clinical trial (ISRCTN 90686599).
 
A key method of investigation by my group is data-linkage to routinely-collected sources. A key example is our development of an innovative mother-and-child pregnancy data-linkage platform (POPStar), involving data from the University of Cambridge, NHS England, the Department for Education and the Office of National Statistics. An example of POPStar platform output is our [recent study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37093852/) of the mid-childhood educational outcomes following fetal growth restriction, which has already generated interest from clinical priority-setting groups. My group also have expertise in primary care data linkage and to electronic hospital records.

Other examples of our research interests include:
* Maternal death review and pregnancy care in Uganda (in collaboration with Professor Annettee Nakimuli)
* Reproductive health care policy (in collaboration with Professor Abigail Aiken)
* Understanding the experiences of women experiencing medically complex pregnancies

As the academic associate training programme director for O&G in the East of England, I play a role in mentoring and supporting the development of aspiring clinical researchers.

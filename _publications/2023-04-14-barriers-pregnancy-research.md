Healthy pregnancies are fundamental to healthy populations, but very few therapies to improve pregnancy outcomes are available. Fundamental concepts-for example, placentation or the mechanisms that control the onset of labor-remain understudied and incompletely understood. A key issue is that research efforts must capture the complexity of the tripartite maternal-placental-fetal system, the dynamics of which change throughout gestation. Studying pregnancy disorders is complicated by the difficulty of creating maternal-placental-fetal interfaces in vitro and the uncertain relevance of animal models to human pregnancy. However, newer approaches include trophoblast organoids to model the developing placenta and integrated data-science approaches to study longer-term outcomes. These approaches provide insights into the physiology of healthy pregnancy, which is the first step to identifying therapeutic targets in pregnancy disorders.

Jasmine is currently an MPhil student studying in the Cambridge University Obs and Gynae department with the support of a Fulbright Scholarship. Before coming to Cambridge, she graduated with a BS in Biological Chemistry from Tulane University in 2024 as a Stamps Scholar and Goldwater Scholar. Throughout her undergraduate years, she researched the biomechanics of the female reproductive system as they relate to maternal aging, postpartum healing, and elastic fiber disruption. She also conducted biophysical research as an Amgen Scholar at the National University of Singapore. In 2022, Jasmine’s team won the Tulane Novel Tech Challenge, in which they designed and prototyped a home-use endometriosis diagnostic test utilizing lateral flow technology.  
 
In the Aiken Group, Jasmine is investigating the outcomes and experiences of pregnant women with cardiac conditions. She plans to address inequities in female healthcare throughout her future career as a clinician scientist. Outside of academics and research, Jasmine enjoys staying active (rowing, weightlifting, and yoga!), playing the violin, traveling, attending concerts, and trying new foods!

My name is Emma Mitchell-Sparke, and I hail from Seattle in the Pacific Northwest. I’m currently a visiting scholar at the University of Cambridge, in between my third and final years of medical school at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston.

Before TUSM, I majored in Sociology and French at Tufts University, graduating in 2020. I then pursued an MPhil in Health, Medicine, and Society at Cambridge, where I focused on reproductive sociology under the supervision of Professor Sarah Franklin. My research examined the rise of fertility startups in the U.S. and the tensions between reproductive technologies that expand choice and their commercialization in for-profit, neoliberal spaces.

After three years of medical school, I realized that my passion for women’s health and the complexities of reproduction made OB/GYN the perfect fit for me. Now, I’m back at Cambridge, working in Professor Catherine Aiken’s research group to study adverse pregnancy conditions. After this year, I’ll return to Boston to complete my final year of medical school before starting OB/GYN residency.

Outside of medicine, I love anything outdoors—running, rowing, hiking—as well as playing saxophone, traveling, and cooking!

### Research Interests
My research explores how environmental and socioeconomic factors shape adverse pregnancy conditions, particularly pre-eclampsia. I have investigated the impact of high-altitude hypoxia on pre-eclampsia risk in Ecuador and am currently examining how socioeconomic status influences pre-eclampsia in Uganda. A central question driving my work is: at the level of the trophoblast, how does the conceptus “sense” maternal socioeconomic status and respond accordingly? This inquiry bridges clinical epidemiology with fundamental biological mechanisms, aiming to understand how structural inequalities manifest at the embryological and placental levels. Using large-scale maternal health data, geospatial analysis, and statistical modelling methods, I seek to uncover patterns that link environmental and social determinants to pregnancy outcomes. Through this research, I hope to contribute to a deeper understanding of maternal health disparities, refine clinical resource allocation, and, ultimately, improve outcomes for more vulnerable patient populations.

Alongside this work, I have also developed a growing interest in early embryonic development, particularly the use of stem-cell-derived embryo models to explore early lineage decisions and placentation. The ethical, policy, scientific, and clinical implications of these models are vast, and I am eager to engage more deeply in the multidisciplinary aspects of this field to better understand its potential for both fundamental discovery and translational impact.

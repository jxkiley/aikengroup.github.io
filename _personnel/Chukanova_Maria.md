I completed my PhD in Clinical Biochemistry in December 2023 at the Institute of Metabolic Science, University of Cambridge. The project focused on characterising obesity-related genes in a human context. I joined the Aiken team in June 2024 to work on evaluating the impact of metformin on the placenta early in pregnancy, using cutting-edge in vitro techniques, including placental organoids. Evidence suggests that metformin could be an effective preventative treatment for both miscarriage and pre-eclampsia. My aim is to investigate whether metformin affects metabolism and improves the establishment of the placenta, providing prophylaxis against pregnancy complications.

Outside of work I do a bit of running and am involved with the Cantabrigian Rowing Club.

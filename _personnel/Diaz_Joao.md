I joined the Department of Paediatrics team as a Clinical Genomics Analyst in 2024. My work focuses on analysing whole genome sequencing data of large cohorts of children with cerebral palsy. Additionally, I am assessing whether receiving a genetic diagnosis affects healthcare utilisation and future risk stratification based on primary care medical records and genetic diagnosis statuses of severely ill children in intensive care.
